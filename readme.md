# Module 3 Lab Exercises

## Description

To make the lab more readable, I have added two files for the JS Fundamental Lab, one is a pdf file and the other is a .js file.
The pdf file.

## Installation

Just Clone the git repo/download the zip file to your local machine and run the files to see the results

## Usage

For each lab in this module, I have a separate .js file and for each js file you'll have some lines of comment instructing you on how to
run the code for easy readability.
Mostly, if you run each question in the file separately, the result will be more readable; especially, for the advanced lab exercise since it's asynchronous

## Technologies Used

- Javascript
- Node Js
